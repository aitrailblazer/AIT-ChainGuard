# AIT-ChainGuard Project Story

## Inspiration
AIT-ChainGuard was born from the vision to redefine personal data management in a world increasingly concerned about privacy and ownership. We were driven by the desire to harness the potential of decentralized technologies to give individuals absolute control and security over their data. The escalating frequency of data breaches and the opaque nature of data handling in centralized systems inspired us to create a solution that is not only secure but also transparent and user-centric. We wanted to empower users by returning the ownership of data back into their hands, leveraging the power of Web5.js and Arweave to make this vision a reality.

## What it does
AIT-ChainGuard is an avant-garde platform enabling users to manage their personal data through a decentralized framework. It empowers users to securely store, manage, and selectively share their data, such as medical records, financial information, and legal documents. It combines the dynamic and real-time data interaction capabilities of Web5 with the immutable, long-term data storage of Arweave, ensuring users' data remains confidential, intact, and accessible only by authorized parties.

## How we built it
AIT-ChainGuard is built using Vue.js to ensure a dynamic and responsive user experience coupled with Web5.js and Arweave on the backend. The integration of these technologies provides a dual-layered defense and empowerment strategy - dynamic for real-time interaction and immutable for long-term data storage. We focused on creating a seamless and intuitive interface, robust data encryption, and secure transaction signing, especially harnessing the capabilities of ARConnect for user-friendly and secure interactions with the Arweave network.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating multiple decentralized technologies to work cohesively while maintaining high security and performance was a significant challenge. Creating a user-friendly interface that simplifies the complexities of blockchain and decentralized networks and ensuring flexible yet secure data sharing mechanisms were among the hurdles we faced. Adapting to the evolving landscape of decentralized applications and ensuring the scalability and interoperability of AIT-ChainGuard was also a complex task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are immensely proud of developing a cutting-edge solution that addresses critical data management issues and sets a new standard in personal data autonomy. Our platform's ability to provide a secure, decentralized, and user-centric approach to data management is a testament to our vision and hard work. We are particularly proud of the intuitive user experience that makes decentralized data management accessible to everyone.

## What we learned

# Understanding ARConnect Permissions

In the AIT-ChainGuard application, the ARConnect wallet is integrated to interact with the Arweave network. It requires specific permissions to perform various actions securely and efficiently. Below is an explanation of the permissions requested by the application and why they are necessary:

## Required ARConnect Permissions:

When `dispatchTransaction` function is called in the AIT-ChainGuard, the following permissions are requested from the ARConnect wallet:

1. **ACCESS_ADDRESS**: 
    - **Purpose**: This permission allows the application to retrieve the wallet's address. It's essential for identifying the user's wallet and facilitating transactions tied to their specific account.
    - **Usage**: In AIT-ChainGuard, accessing the user's address is critical for creating and managing transactions related to personal data storage and retrieval.

2. **SIGN_TRANSACTION**: 
    - **Purpose**: This permission is crucial for authorizing and signing transactions. It ensures that the user has explicitly approved any action that alters their data or involves token transfer.
    - **Usage**: Every time a user wants to upload data to Arweave or perform any transaction, SIGN_TRANSACTION permission ensures that the operation is authenticated and executed securely.

3. **DISPATCH**: 
    - **Purpose**: The DISPATCH permission is specifically for submitting transactions to the Arweave network. It allows the ARConnect wallet to send the signed transactions to be stored on the blockchain.
    - **Usage**: This is used in AIT-ChainGuard when the application needs to dispatch the transaction for data storage. It ensures that the data, once signed, is properly sent and recorded on the Arweave network.

## Why These Permissions Are Essential:

- **Security**: By explicitly requesting these permissions, ARConnect ensures that the user is aware of and consents to the actions performed by the application on their behalf. It prevents unauthorized transactions and access to user data.
- **Functionality**: These permissions are integral to the application's functionality. Without them, AIT-ChainGuard wouldn't be able to perform the necessary operations to manage and store personal data securely on the Arweave network.
- **User Control**: The permission model empowers users by giving them control over the application's access to their wallet. Users can revoke these permissions at any time, thereby stopping any further transactions or data access.

By understanding and granting these permissions, users can confidently use AIT-ChainGuard to manage their personal data, assured by the security and functionality provided by the ARConnect wallet and Arweave network.

# Function: dispatchTransaction

The `dispatchTransaction` function is a critical component of the AIT-ChainGuard application, enabling users to securely dispatch their personal data transactions to the Arweave network. Here's a detailed breakdown of its process:

## Overview:
This function encapsulates the entire process of sending a transaction to the Arweave network, which involves checking for wallet availability, creating a transaction with user data, signing it, dispatching it to the network, and storing the transaction ID for future reference.

## Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Check for ArConnect Availability**:
    - `if (!window.arweaveWallet) { throw new Error("ArConnect extension is not installed or not enabled.") }`: This line checks if the ArConnect wallet is available in the browser. If not, it throws an error, prompting the user to ensure that ArConnect is installed and enabled.

2. **Request User Permissions**:
    - `await window.arweaveWallet.connect(["ACCESS_ADDRESS", "SIGN_TRANSACTION", "DISPATCH"])`: This line requests the user to grant permission for the application to access their address, sign transactions, and dispatch them to the network via the ArConnect wallet.

3. **Create Transaction with Aggregated Data**:
    - `let tx = await arweave.createTransaction({ data: userInput.value })`: This line initializes a new transaction with the user's input data.
    - The transaction is then enhanced with tags (`App-Name`, `Content-Type`, `Version`, `Type`) to provide metadata, identifying the application, content type, version, and nature of the transaction.

4. **Sign and Dispatch the Transaction**:
    - `await arweave.transactions.sign(tx)`: This line signs the transaction with the user's private key from the ArConnect wallet, a crucial step for security and authorization.
    - `let result = await window.arweaveWallet.dispatch(tx)`: This line dispatches the signed transaction to the Arweave network. The network then processes and stores the transaction if it's valid.

5. **Store the Transaction ID for Future Reference**:
    - `transactionId.value = result.id`: This line captures the unique Transaction ID assigned by the network and stores it in the application state. This ID is critical for retrieving or referencing the transaction in the future.
    - `await storeTransactionIdInWeb5(transactionId.value)`: This line stores the transaction ID in Web5, ensuring consistency and facilitating recovery through decentralized web services.

## Error Handling:
- The try-catch block encapsulates the entire transaction dispatch process, catching and logging any errors encountered during the operation. This robust error handling ensures that any issues are appropriately addressed, and users are informed of any failures in the transaction process.

## Conclusion:
The `dispatchTransaction` function is a testament to AIT-ChainGuard's commitment to secure, user-friendly, and reliable personal data management. By leveraging the Arweave network and ArConnect wallet, it ensures that users' data is not only securely stored but also perpetually accessible, reflecting the core principles of AIT-ChainGuard's mission.
